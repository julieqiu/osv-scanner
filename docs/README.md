# README
The [OSV-Scanner docs](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner) are hosted on a [GitHub page](https://pages.github.com/). 

Changes in documentation, new features, etc. are added to the [working docs](working_docs/). Docs in the working folder do not represent the current release of OSV-Scanner.

## Contributing to the docs
Documentation contributions are welcome!

OSV-Scanner docs are splic between the `current` folder and the `working_docs` folder. Docs within the `current` folder reflect the current state of OSV-Scanner. Docs within `working_docs` may include features and options that are not available in the currently released version of OSV-Scanner. 

Contributors should make changes to the documentation in the[working docs](working_docs/) directory. Maintainers will copy text from `working_docs` into `current` as neccesary to keep the `current` docs up-to-date.  

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidelines.
